This package allows you to treat a Laravel Eloquent model and its relationships as
[extended state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Extended_states)
in a [hierarchical state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Hierarchically_nested_states).

The philosophy that sets this package apart from most other state machine implementations is that
behavior is declared **in code** in classes representing *states* and *events*,
and the *model* itself determines the current state.
There is no overall configuration of the state machine's *graph*.
The current state handles incoming events and *transitions* the model into another state.

- Every state and event is represented by a PHP class, extending a relevant base class.
- A state declares the *superstate* (*composite* or *root*) it belongs too.
- Events are dispatched through the model to the current state.
- Event handling happens within database transactions with pessimistic row-locks.
- The current state evaluates an incoming event (*guards*) and may initiate a *transition* to another (named) state.
- Events not explicitly handled by the current state will bubble up the state branch.
- States have *entry* and *exit* actions and events have *actions* that manipulate the model during a transition.
- Side effects can be deferred for processing to after the transition is completed.
- Any anomalies during transitions throws exceptions, triggering transaction rollback.

## Requirements

Row-level locking is only supported in MySQL / MariaDB and PostgreSQL.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require bjuppa/eloquent-state-machine
```

## Usage

Start by drawing a *statechart* for your state machine, without it you will probably miss some state, transition, event
or action.

**Everything** related to a specific state in the chart is coded directly into distinct methods of that state's
PHP class.
